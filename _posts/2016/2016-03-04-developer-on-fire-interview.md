I recently had the pleasure of being interviewed by [Dave Rael](https://twitter.com/raelyard "Dave Rael") on his [Developer on Fire](http://developeronfire.com/ "Developer on Fire") podcast.  The show is pretty unique in that Dave follows a template he created that focuses on the guest, their experiences, and what makes them tick.

Here is the description of the show:

> Podcast with inspiring interviews with successful software developers, architects, testers, and other professionals with stories of success, failure, excellence, and inspiration.

It was a lot of fun speaking with Dave and I hope you enjoy it!
