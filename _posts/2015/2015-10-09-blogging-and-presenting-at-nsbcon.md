What could be better as my *first* post than a post about the *first* conference I'll be speaking at?  A *first* post where the intent of both the blog and *first* presentation are one in the same!

I'll be presenting at [NSBCon 2015](http://particular.net/nsbcon2015) which is an "All About NServiceBus" conference.  It's a great conference for anyone interested in topics such as distributed systems, messaging, and microservices.  While the focus is on NServiceBus and the Particular Platform, I think anyone interested in similar topics could learn a lot by attending as the underlying concepts are translatable between technologies and platforms.

The full title of my talk is: 

>Decomposing the domain:  Transforming a tightly-coupled synchronous process into an SOA/Messaging based solution using NServiceBus  

While I'm very much interested in all those buzzwords (SOA, Messaging, NServiceBus, etc.), what will be at the heart of the presentation (and this blog) is how to break apart problems, turn them on their head, and weigh potential solutions based on properties that are present in a given domain through deep and continuous business analysis.

As an industry, we often (even against our best efforts) make the following mistakes:

- Receive "requirements" and perceive them as fact
- Assume existing "requirements" along with their solutions are fact
- Jump to a solution before understanding the problem
- Let tools and technologies impose artificial constraints
	
The resulting software typically ends up being overly complex with a lot of accidental complexity, doesn't quite achieve what the business was originally trying to accomplish, and worst of all, creates obstacles that can hinder the business when exploring new opportunities.  

While I will blog about technologies and their low-level details from time to time, the area I'm going to focus in is about my experience encountering some of the issues I've described above, how I've handled them, and what worked or didn't work.

Enjoy!
